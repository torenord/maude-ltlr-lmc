The source of the Fair LTLR model checker and the LMC model checker are in the 
directory src/ModelChecker. These components are developed in C++11, and thus
require version 4.8 of gcc or later, with CXXFLAGS option -std=c++11. 

In addtion, the following files define the interfaces of the model checkers.

- src/Main/ltlr-checker.maude : Core Maude interface of LTLR
- src/Main/ltlr-interface.maude : Full Maude interface of LTLR
- src/Main/symbolic-checker.maude : Full Maude interface of LMC

The Full Maude interfaces (the first and the last) also need Full Maude 2.7. 
Some examples are provided in the directories src/Main/ltlr-examples and 
src/Main/symbolic-examples, respectively.
